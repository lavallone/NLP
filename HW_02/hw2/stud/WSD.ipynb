Without *LSTM*, it would have been impossible to encode information about the context of words (basic for our task) and it's probably the main block of the model. With respect to *vanilla RNNs*, it overcomes the vanishing gradient problem and it most robust to long term dependencies between words. One of its greatest power is the possibility of encoding the sequence both from *left-to-right* and *from right-to-left* to further enhance contextualization (***Bi-LSTMS***). To increase the performance I played and tweaked with *hidden_dim*, *bidirectional* and *num_layers* hyperparameter values.\n",

For example if the prediction is \"*B-ACTION*\" at position *i*, the system should understand that the probability that \"I-ACTION\" is at *i+1* is higher than position *i-1*. It didn't work as expected: maybe because the positional encoding expresses its full potential in the moment in which *attention* in involved. \n",

This because I noticed that most of the time the *events* are verbs (VERB) and I thought that giving the model an information like this it would have helped it.
