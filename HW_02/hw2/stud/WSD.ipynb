It's quite clear that by using it the performance of the model will increase. <br> *Word2Vec* was a possible choice but it generated, according to me, too many *OOV* words and *fastText* was maybe the best choice (many people tell so) but dealing with subwords embeddings was not the best idea.

I had three options from the Stanford website but at the end I decided to download \"***glove.6B.zip***\" because is *uncased*, it has a relatively small vocabulary size (*400K*) with respect to other options but big enough for my purposes and it has four different word embedding sizes (50, 100, 200 and 300) for making experiments. \n",

It didn't work as expected: maybe because the positional encoding expresses its full potential in the moment in which *attention* in involved. \n",
